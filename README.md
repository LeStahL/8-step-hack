# Create Expression Pedal Shapes with your MIDI Controller: 8-step-hack
Midi controller fader 8-step mod wheel emulator means: Wire your synthesizer to a MIDI interface output of your PC. Wire your MIDI controller with faders to a MIDI
interface input of your PC. Run the 8-step-hack. Create a LFO shape with the faders on your Controller. Send it to your synthesizer using the Expression pedal MIDI 
capabilities of your synthesizer.

# Supported Hardware
The project is still work in progress, so the support ranges only over controllers I own. Planned controllers are:
* Akai APC40 MkII
* Korg NanoKontrol2
